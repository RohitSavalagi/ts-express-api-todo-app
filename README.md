git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-backend.git
cd todo-backend

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Create .env File

Create a .env file in the root:

PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/todoDB
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

User signs up → password hashed

User logs in → JWT token issued

User sends token in headers

Authorization: Bearer <token>


Middleware validates token → allows access to CRUD routes

📦 Scripts
Command	Description
npm run dev	Run development with nodemon
npm run build	Build TypeScript to JS
npm start	Start production server
🧪 Future Enhancements

Add refresh token mechanism

Add due dates & reminders
